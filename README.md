# musescore-dataset

The unofficial dataset of all music sheets and users on musescore.com, dedicated to big data analytics / data science / machine learning.

> All data is collected by iterating through [musecore.com's *public* API](https://developers.musescore.com/).

> The `jsonl` files are in the [Newline-delimited JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Line-delimited_JSON) ([JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/)) format.

**Only need the sheet files to learn music? try [musescore-downloader](https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader).**
